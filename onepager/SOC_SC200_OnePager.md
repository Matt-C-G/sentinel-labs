# SOC/SC-200 Proof Pack â€” One Pager

**What this proves**
- I can **hunt** (KQL), **detect** (rules), **respond** (playbook), and **report** (workbook).
- Everything is importable; evidence screenshots go in `evidence/`.

**Artifacts**
- 6 KQL queries, 3 rules (JSON), 1 workbook (JSON), 1 playbook (ARM), KEV watchlist CSV.

**Story to tell**
1) Connect data sources (Defender, AAD, DNS).  
2) Hunt with KQL for anomalies.  
3) Promote high-signal hunts to scheduled rules.  
4) Auto-tag/assign incidents via playbook.  
5) Show KEV exposure and time-to-closure in the workbook.
